<h4>"“I don’t like girls”: Centring Young Children’s Perspectives on Gender in Early Childhood Care and Education settings"</h4>
<h5>Chloe Hurley</h5>
This paper demonstrates that young children actively construct and reproduce gender norms within ECCE settings, insights that are often
missed in adult-centred research. By centring children’s perspectives, it highlights critical gaps in educators’ gender-focused DEI knowledge and practices and the need for gender-responsive professional development.

<h4>Pelvic health: lived experience, needs and resources for women
with pelvic organ prolapse</h4>
<h5>Louise Carrol</h5>

<h4>The Ripple Effect: How the HSE Data Breach Shaped Public
Opinion</h4>
<h5>Mugdha Srivastava</h5>
Healthcare data breaches don’t just reduce trust, they change what
trust depends on. After the Health Service Executive cyberattack,
people were less concerned about technical security and more wor-
ried about who can access and share their data. They still use and
trust digital services, but they expect greater visibility and better
incident reporting. This suggests that trustworthy artificial intelli-
gence in healthcare must use and keep data visible and verifiable.

<h4>Bridging the Interdisciplinary Gap between Food Studies and
Literary Studies: Gastrocriticism</h4>
<h5>Anke Klitzing</h5>
Interdisciplinary work is valued but its intrinsic challenges are of-
ten neglected, especially with regards to training novice scholars.
In the interdisciplinary field of Literary Food Studies, the gastrocrit-
ical approach with the heuristic tool of the Gastrocritical Reading
Questions offers a solution to bridging this interdisciplinary gap.
