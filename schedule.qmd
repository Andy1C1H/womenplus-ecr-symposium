<h4>"“I don’t like girls”: Centring Young Children’s Perspectives on Gender in Early Childhood Care and Education settings"</h4>
<h5>Chloe Hurley</h5>
This paper demonstrates that young children actively construct and reproduce gender norms within ECCE settings, insights that are often
missed in adult-centred research. By centring children’s perspectives, it highlights critical gaps in educators’ gender-focused DEI knowledge and practices and the need for gender-responsive professional development.

<h4>Pelvic health: lived experience, needs and resources for women
with pelvic organ prolapse</h4>
<h5>Louise Carrol</h5>
This thesis demonstrates that pelvic organ prolapse (POP)
is a common, disabling female health issue, signicantly affecting women’s physical, emotional, and social well-being. The research shows that women, particularly those of re-
productive age, experience substantial knowledge gaps, difficulty accessing trustworthy information, and barriers to seeking and receiving care, which contribute to distress and
reduced quality of life. Through systematic review, qualitative research, and co-design methodology, the thesis identifies these unmet needs and responds by developing and
evaluating a national evidence-based educational website www.pelvichealthireland.ie to improve pelvic health literacy, reduce stigma and support self-management. The work argues for a shift toward patient-centred, biopsychosocial, and empowerment-focused approaches in pelvic health research and clinical practice.
