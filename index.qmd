title: "Women+ ECR Symposium"
---

On the **6^th^ of March** **2026,** to celebrate International Women’s Day, we will hold our first *Women+ in Early Career Research Symposium* at TU Dublin's city campus. The aim of this symposium is to create a supportive, inclusive space to showcase research, foster cross-disciplinary dialogue, and build networks among women and gender-diverse researchers at early career stages.

We invite paper submissions from **early-career women+ researchers** across disciplines, including STEM, humanities, health, creative practice, and interdisciplinary work. We especially encourage submissions from researchers whose voices are underrepresented in academia, including those from marginalized backgrounds, caregiving roles, regional institutions, and non-traditional career pathways.

Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the symposium, researchers outside your field may be reviewing your paper; for this reason, we ask all papers, presentations, and posters to be pitched at a broad scientific audience level. All accepted papers will be published on [Arrow](https://arrow.tudublin.ie/) TU Dublin’s Open Access institutional repository. There will be no charge for attending the symposium or publishing on Arrow.
