    "text": "Our Mission\nResearch can often be a solitary pursuit and women+ researchers face unique challenges, including the leaky pipeline where the number of women seen in higher positions decreases (WREN and Science Policy Review). We aim to break down silos and systemic challenges by building a vibrant, effective research community in Dublin and the surrounding areas. By being women+ centred, we aim to address the structural and cultural barriers that disproportionately affect women and gender-diverse researchers at the start of their careers. By fostering an interdisciplinary environment, we move beyond subject-specific bubbles to focus on academic skills: rigorous research practices, effective writing, presentation skills, and career navigation.\nWe support our community with these skills as well as with building strong interdisciplinary networks and robust peer-mentorships that can reduce the effect of the leaky pipeline."

The identity deliberately reclaims that visual language, transforming it into something inclusive, modern, and community-led.\nThe shield is divided into interwoven, abstract sections, representing the many disciplines within early career research. Rather than separating fields, these forms connect and overlap, reinforcing the idea that progress is made through collaboration, shared knowledge, and mutual support."

The aim of this symposium is to create a supportive, inclusive space to showcase research, foster cross-disciplinary dialogue, and build networks among women and gender-diverse researchers at early career stages.\nWe invite paper submissions from early-career women+ researchers across disciplines, including STEM, humanities, health, creative practice, and interdisciplinary work. We especially encourage submissions from researchers whose voices are underrepresented in academia, including those from marginalized backgrounds, caregiving roles, regional institutions, and non-traditional career pathways.\nDue to the interdisciplinary nature of the symposium, researchers outside your field may be reviewing your paper; for this reason, we ask all papers, presentations, and posters to be pitched at a broad scientific audience level. All accepted papers will be published on Arrow TU Dublin’s Open Access institutional repository. There will be no charge for publishing on Arrow."

    "section": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a “1st Year PhD track” and a “lightning talk”?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only difference between between the talks is who else will be presenting alongside you. We understand being a first year PhD can be intimidating so made a track to encourage participation. If you are in the first 18 months of your PhD and don’t mind who else is presenting in your session you are welcome to apply for both.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould I include my supervisors as authors?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is up to your own discretion, we advise including supervisors if you are submitting a paper based on the research they supervise. Some people might submit “passion project work” or something that isn’t directly related to their research. For example someone might submit “this is what I learned teaching computer science in university” and their research might have nothing to do with teaching. In this scenario we advise you include those who you deem should be included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should the format be?\n\n\n\n\n\n⁠If you download the latex template it has abstract, introduction, insert sections you deem appropriate conclusion and a few other bits. People may be desk rejected from not using the template, and the marking scheme will reference elements in the template. If there is an issue with using the template please contact us. See Format\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould I include all the headings in the template?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. Our marking scheme will reference elements in the template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhats a BLUF and why do I need it?\n\n\n\n\n\nBLUF or Bottom Line Upfront is a short 1 to 2 sentences about your submission. In our publication readers will be able to look at the BLUF and gain an understanding of what the research is about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen will presentation formats be chosen?\n\n\n\n\n\nPut down what type of presentation(s) you want to do and if you are selected we will let you know what presentation you will do based on other submissions and reviewers feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould we include a funding body/acknowledgement section?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is at the discretion of the author. If you are presenting on your research that is funded by “X” put down an acknowledgement section. If you are speaking on your passion project or something you are doing outside your research funding I would see that as not needing to acknowledge “X”. But we can’t comment on what contract someone signed for their funding if you are in doubt please check with your funding body as each funding body is different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would like to review submissions how does that work?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease email andrea.c.heaney@mytudublin.ie and we will send on further information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I have to be a Woman+ or in my early career to review?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo we are happy to have reviewers of any and all backgrounds please email andrea.c.heaney@mytudublin.ie and we will send on further information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere is the line between a marketing style and an accessible communication style?\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing style from my point of view would be more persuasive as in you should read this paper to know more about this. Marketing style would also use a lot of catchy language but doesn’t always back it up. It leaves you guessing. Where as science communication language would focus more on educating the reader and translating scientific language to more accessible language without oversimplifying.\nFor example if your title was this “the woes and wonders of computer science” that’s great marketing but tells us nothing about the topic and is poor science communication. But if you changed it to something like “the woes and wonders of computer science: what interviews can tell us about the challenges and opportunities of being a student studying computer science” That’s a lot more clear I know what the paper will be about.\nWe are happy if you want to use language to hook us in. But be sure to not leave us hanging in any part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I write a science communication abstact?\n\n\n\n\n\nLike any other abstract it should be a concise, standalone summary of the paper, with accessible language so someone outside your domain can understand your research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I need to submit a form and email the PDF?\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately our organisation has a restriction on uploading PDF’s into microsoft forms. For this reason please fill out the form and email the pdf. The form captures important data which is not present in the paper template. See How to Submit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I need to remove my identifiable information before submitting?/ Is the reviewing double blinded?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. It is a single blind review process (i.e. your reviewer will know you but you wont know your reviewer) but we will ensure the reviewer doesn’t have an affiliation with you."
