    "text": "Our Mission\nResearch can often be a solitary pursuit and women+ researchers face unique challenges, including the leaky pipeline where the number of women seen in higher positions decreases (WREN and Science Policy Review). We aim to break down silos and systemic challenges by building a vibrant, effective research community in Dublin and the surrounding areas. By being women+ centred, we aim to address the structural and cultural barriers that disproportionately affect women and gender-diverse researchers at the start of their careers. By fostering an interdisciplinary environment, we move beyond subject-specific bubbles to focus on academic skills: rigorous research practices, effective writing, presentation skills, and career navigation.\nWe support our community with these skills as well as with building strong interdisciplinary networks and robust peer-mentorships that can reduce the effect of the leaky pipeline."

We hope to achieve this via a curated schedule of events including:\n\nInternational Women’s Day Research Symposium focusing on the research being conducted by our members with abstracts published on ARROW@TU Dublin.\nWorkshops ranging from academic writing and poster design and development to half day focused writing sessions.\nCommunity support via active WhatsApp group and monthly in-person coffee socials in Dublin."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On the 6th of March 2026, to celebrate International Women’s Day, we will hold our first Women+ in Early Career Research Symposium at TU Dublin’s city campus. The aim of this symposium is to create a supportive, inclusive space to showcase research, foster cross-disciplinary dialogue, and build networks among women and gender-diverse researchers at early career stages.\nWe invite paper submissions from early-career women+ researchers across disciplines, including STEM, humanities, health, creative practice, and interdisciplinary work. We especially encourage submissions from researchers whose voices are underrepresented in academia, including those from marginalized backgrounds, caregiving roles, regional institutions, and non-traditional career pathways.\nDue to the interdisciplinary nature of the symposium, researchers outside your field may be reviewing your paper; for this reason, we ask all papers, presentations, and posters to be pitched at a broad scientific audience level. All accepted papers will be published on Arrow TU Dublin’s Open Access institutional repository. There will be no charge for publishing on Arrow."
